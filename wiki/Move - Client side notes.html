<p>
Most people come directly to specific event if acquired from newsletter. We need to make sure they can transition to other events/ sources of information as easily as possible.
Possible things to do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Show popular events (based on clicks or tickets bought)

<li>
Show other events around the same time (Maybe need to reconsider showing events that are same time as event page)

<li>
Share Buttons

</ul>

<div id="Explore Page"><h3 id="Explore Page" class="header"><a href="#Explore Page">Explore Page</a></h3></div>
<p>
Needs some reconstruction in terms of formatting
Event Criteria takes up half of page, need to slim down so user gets glimpse of events on page load
Better way to query data (Only show free events, show different vibes, etc)
</p>

<div id="FUTURE"><h3 id="FUTURE" class="header"><a href="#FUTURE">FUTURE</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Success Page after people buy ticker

<li>
Log if user drops off after not buying ticket when clicking buy

<li>
Carousel of event for that week for that week

<li>
Similar events in a carousel / Cateogirze my moob/vive?``;sq

<li>
Organizer Page

</ul>
